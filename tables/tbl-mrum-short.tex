\caption{Infernal predicted RNAs in the archaeon
  \emph{Methanobrevibacter ruminantium} (GenBank accession
  CP001719.1). All Rfam 10.0 families \cite{Gardner11} for which
  Infernal finds at least one unique hit with a bit score above the
  Rfam bit-score gathering threshold (GA) and an E-value below $0.01$ are
  shown. Also shown is LSU rRNA, which is not in Rfam, because LSU
  rRNA are annotated in GenBank. 
  Non-obvious column heading descriptions:
%  "\# in GenBank'': number of RNAs in GenBank
%  annotation; 
  ``believed'': hits believed to be real homologs, these are all
  nonoverlapping hits with E-values below $0.01$; ``unique'': number
  of nonoverlapping Infernal hits above GA cutoff, overlaps of more
  than 50\% the length of the shorter sequence were removed by keeping
  the highest bit score amongst the overlapping hits; ``total'': total
  Infernal hits above GA cutoff, including overlaps; ``best hit'': bit
  scores and E-values of the best scoring hits for each family.}
%The following
%  sets of families shared overlapping hits, the family with the
%  highest bit score for all overlaps is listed first: SRP\_euk\_arch
%  and SRP\_bact (1 hit), CRISPR-DR2 and CRISPR-DR39 (60 hits), and
%  sR1, sR2, sR8 and snoPyro\_CD (1 hit).}
